# Load YMD Context

# ⚠️ ENFORCEMENT MODE: Principles Below Are MANDATORY

**CRITICAL: These are not suggestions - they are HARD REQUIREMENTS.**

**Before proceeding with ANY task after loading these principles:**
1. ✅ RESEARCH the codebase (use Glob/Grep/Read tools)
2. ✅ CHECK for duplication (search for existing implementations)
3. ✅ DETECT user's mode (EXPLORING/RESEARCHING/PLANNING/IMPLEMENTING)
4. ✅ VALIDATE against loaded principles

**HALT conditions (stop and report to user):**
- Creating files without research → VIOLATION
- Duplicating existing code → VIOLATION
- Jumping user's mode without signal → VIOLATION
- Skipping research phase → VIOLATION

**These principles enforce themselves. Compliance is not optional.**
